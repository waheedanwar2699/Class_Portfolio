II. Summary:

Throughout this course I have gained insight and experience with utilizing tools that help perform machine learning, analysis, and handling both small and large  sets of data. My favorite aspect of machine learning was when using R because personally for me it was easier to pick up than Python, atleast in the scope of machine learning. However, for normal development I would use Python instead but the truth is that R had the advantage because of its more easier use and something clicked with me due to its sole focus on being a statistical programming language. With Python I felt the opposite. I'm really grateful to have a much better understanding of machine learning now and how different algorithms help to train/test data. It was actually much more fun than I expected so i'm going to plan to do some personal projects in the future because being in the tech industry having these skills is very beneficial and will give me the edge in opening up more job opportunites. If I go into databases aspect of CS then handling large amounts of information will help me associate that with how I handled large amounts of data here, of course those jobs operate at a much larger scale. I also really loved the teamwork aspect as I felt being able to ask questions from others who were operating on the same data set was really beneficial for me. Overall this is a class and topic that I will keep with me throughout my career.
